# Hirefolio

**A fork-and-go, self-hostable portfolio + recruiter-communication platform for job-seeking software
engineers** — semantic blog search, local-AI tagging, and an admin console, deployable under *your*
own name and domain.

> **Name change (#88):** the project is now **Hirefolio** and the repository is
> [`mavrovde/hirefolio`](https://github.com/mavrovde/hirefolio) (GitHub redirects the old
> `mavrovde/mavrov.de` URLs, and `git remote` keeps working — but update your remote when convenient:
> `git remote set-url origin https://github.com/mavrovde/hirefolio.git`).
> `mavrov.de` remains the maintainer's own deployment of it, not the product name.
> Container images publish to `ghcr.io/mavrovde/hirefolio-*` from the first build after the rename;
> images published earlier still live at `ghcr.io/mavrovde/mavrov.de-*`, so pin `IMAGE_REPO`
> explicitly when deploying a pre-rename tag. **One-time owner action:** those four new GHCR
> packages are created **private** (visibility does not follow a repo rename) — make them public
> once, or the host, which pulls without a login, cannot fetch them. See
> [`docs/DEPLOYMENT.md`](docs/DEPLOYMENT.md#registry-notes).

## 🚀 Features

**Portfolio**
- **Modern Portfolio**: Showcase experience, skills, education, and recommendations
- **Multilingual**: Full support for English and German with real-time switching
- **Blog with Semantic Search**: AI-powered content discovery using `nomic-embed-text` embeddings
- **AI Tag Generation**: Auto-suggest tags for posts using a local `llama3.2:1b` model
- **Responsive Design**: Works seamlessly on desktop and mobile
- **Admin Dashboard**: Secure interface for managing posts (rich editor, drafting, publishing)

**Job search** (v1.12.0)
- **Recruiter inbox** (#69): every inbound touch — public contact form, CV requests — lands as one
  indexable interaction with a status workflow (new → contacted → in_progress → closed) and an
  email alert to the owner. The public write is rate-limited per client IP and normalized
  server-side.
- **Opportunity pipeline** (#247 phase 1): a stage board (lead → … → closed), a notes timeline per
  opportunity, and one-click **promote** turning an inbox message into a pipeline card that keeps
  the original text as its first note.

**Make it yours**
- **Runtime configuration** (#65): identity — site name/URL, owner name/headline/description,
  social links, analytics id — comes from `.env` and the admin panel at runtime, so a fork runs
  the prebuilt images without rebuilding.
- **Guided setup** (#61): `./setup.sh` generates secrets, writes `.env`, boots the stack and seeds
  the admin user.
- **Demo persona by default** (#66): the repo ships fictional content, never a real résumé; a PII
  guard fails the pipeline if personal identifiers reappear. **Set your identity in the host
  `.env` before deploying** — see `docs/DEPLOYMENT.md`.
- **Type-Safe**: Full TypeScript/Python type coverage

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Frontend

- **Framework**: Angular 22 (Standalone Components, RxJS + `async` pipe for state — Signals only for local component state, Native SSR `server.mjs`)
- **Styling**: TailwindCSS 4.x, Dark/Light mode
- **State Management**: RxJS 7.8 Observables
- **Testing**: Vitest 4.1 (Unit, replaced Jasmine/Karma), Playwright 1.62 (E2E)
- **i18n**: Custom translation service

### Backend

- **Framework**: FastAPI 0.141 (Python 3.12 — the version the Docker images and CI run)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL 16 with `pgvector` extension
- **AI**: Ollama (Local LLM & Embeddings)
  - Embeddings: `nomic-embed-text`
  - Chat/generation: `llama3.2`
  - Fast metadata/tags: `llama3.2:1b`
- **ORM**: SQLAlchemy 2.0.52 (async)
- **Testing**: pytest + Vitest (100% line & branch coverage)

### CI/CD Pipeline

- **Platform**: GitHub Actions
- **Quality Gates**:
  - Linting (Ruff 0.16 for the backend; no frontend linter is configured — the CI
    frontend-lint job runs `npm run lint --if-present`, which is currently a no-op)
  - Type Checking (MyPy)
  - Security Scanning (Bandit)
  - Unit Tests (Frontend & Backend)
  - E2E Tests (Playwright with real Ollama integration)
- **When each gate runs** (#208):

  | stage | pull request | push to `main` |
  |---|---|---|
  | Lint · types · security · unit tests · migrations · version consistency | ✅ | ✅ |
  | Build images · Docker E2E · publish to GHCR · roll out to prod | — | ✅ |

  Every build/publish/deploy job is gated on `github.event_name == 'push'`, so a pull request runs
  the verification jobs and **cannot** publish an image or touch the prod host. No job that runs on a
  pull request reads a repository secret, which also keeps fork PRs working. The Docker E2E stays on
  `main` because it needs the built images; run it locally with `./verify_all.sh` before merging
  anything that touches SSR, HTTP wiring, or change detection (see
  `.claude/skills/lessons-learned/SKILL.md`).

- **Optimization**: Playwright-browser caching in CI — deliberately **no** multi-GB caches for Docker base images or AI model weights (measured net-negative; see `.claude/skills/lessons-learned/SKILL.md` §5)

## 📋 Prerequisites

- **Node.js** 22 (what CI uses; npm 10+)
- **Python** 3.12 (what the Docker images and CI use; a newer local venv may work but is not the reference)
- **PostgreSQL** 16+
- **Docker/Podman** (Recommended for local dev)
- **Ollama** (If running locally without Docker)

## 🚀 Quick Start

### One command (recommended — LOCAL quickstart)

> **Scope:** `setup.sh` boots the **dev** compose stack — local builds, dev ports
> (4200/8000/11434/5433 on all interfaces) and default Postgres credentials;
> `setup.sh` always ensures a real JWT secret in `.env` (generating one when absent) (the ephemeral JWT
> is the dev-compose escape hatch when you bypass setup, not the default). Perfect for trying the product and local
> development. **For a real server** follow
> [`docs/DEPLOYMENT.md` → "First deploy (clean server)"](docs/DEPLOYMENT.md) —
> prod compose, prebuilt images, hardened settings.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mavrovde/hirefolio.git
cd hirefolio
./setup.sh          # prompts for your name/site; --defaults for a demo persona
```

`setup.sh` creates `.env` from the sample, **generates strong secrets** (JWT signing key + admin
password — printed once, stored only in your gitignored `.env`), records your identity for the
runtime site config (#65 — change it later in `.env`, no rebuild), starts the Docker stack, and
waits for the backend health gate. Re-running is safe: values already set are never overwritten.

Then open <http://localhost:4200> (public site) and <http://admin.localhost:4200> (admin, user
`admin`). **Make it yours** — the whole checklist is config + admin uploads, zero code edits:

1. `.env`: `OWNER_NAME`, `OWNER_HEADLINE`, `SITE_NAME`, `SITE_URL`, `SOCIAL_LINKS`,
   `HIREFOLIO_ANALYTICS_ID` (identity, #65) · `PUBLIC_SERVER_NAME`/`ADMIN_SERVER_NAME` (your
   domain) · `IMAGE_REPO` (your registry, for prod).
2. Admin panel: upload your **Profile Data** JSON and your **CV** (Content → replaces the demo).
3. Optional: LinkedIn import (`importer/README.md`), Gemini key (`HIREFOLIO_GEMINI_API_KEY` —
   empty keeps the free local Ollama).

### Manual start (the same stack, no wizard)

```bash
# Start all services (incl. Mailpit — every notification email lands in the
# catch-all inbox at http://localhost:8025, nothing leaves the machine; #262)
./manage.sh start

# View logs
./manage.sh logs

# Stop services
./manage.sh stop
```

### Manual Setup (Local Dev)

#### Backend

```bash
cd backend
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Start DB (using Docker is easiest for PGVector)
docker run -d -p 5432:5432 -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=postgres pgvector/pgvector:pg16

# Run Migrations
alembic upgrade head

# Start Server
uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```

> **Alembic is the single, authoritative schema-management mechanism** — the backend no longer
> calls `Base.metadata.create_all` at startup. Docker images run `alembic upgrade head` via
> `backend/docker-entrypoint.sh` before the app starts (idempotent — a no-op once the DB is at
> head); running it manually is only needed for local dev outside Docker. See
> [`backend/migrations/`](./backend/migrations/) and
> [How to write a migration](#how-to-write-a-migration) below.

#### How to write a migration

```bash
cd backend
# 1. Change a model in app/models/*.py
# 2. Generate a migration from the diff (review it — autogenerate misses some things,
#    e.g. data backfills, column renames it sees as drop+add, and check constraints):
alembic revision --autogenerate -m "describe the change"
# 3. Apply it locally and confirm it's the diff you expect:
alembic upgrade head
# 4. Guard against drift — this must report "No new upgrade operations detected.":
alembic check
```

A non-additive change (column type change, `NOT NULL` backfill, rename, new constraint) goes
through the same `alembic revision --autogenerate` + hand-edit workflow — Alembic (unlike
`create_all`) can express and apply these safely.

**If your migration CREATES a table or index, start it with the self-adopt guard:**

```python
if sa.inspect(op.get_bind()).has_table("your_table"):
    return  # pre-Alembic install already has it (create_all) — adopt, don't crash
```

Long-lived deployments got their schema from `create_all` before Alembic existed (the entrypoint
stamps `baseline0001` over whatever is there), so a plain `op.create_table` explodes with
`DuplicateTable` on them. `inbox0003` is the reference example; the lessons-learned skill has the
full story. Test both directions: clean DB → creates; `create_all` DB → no-ops.

#### Frontend

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm start
```

## 🤖 AI Assistant (Claude Code)

**Claude Code is the primary AI tool for this project.** All assistant guidance lives in
[`CLAUDE.md`](./CLAUDE.md) (stack facts, commands, the LinkedIn pipeline, engineering rules, and the
configured MCP servers / subagents / plugins / slash commands). Legacy per-tool files
(`.cursorrules`, `.windsurfrules`, `.cline.md`, `.geminirules`, `AI.md`, `.clauderules`) are thin
pointers to `CLAUDE.md`.

Project-scoped Claude Code tooling: subagents under `.claude/agents/` (`devops-pipeline`,
`backend-dev`, `frontend-dev`), slash commands under `.claude/commands/` (`/verify`, `/release`,
`/linkedin-sync`), and the plugins listed in `CLAUDE.md`.

### MCP Servers

A project-scoped `.mcp.json` configures Model Context Protocol servers to speed up development with Claude Code. On first use, Claude Code will ask you to approve the project's MCP servers.

| Server | Purpose | Requirements |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `postgres` | Read-only SQL queries against the `pgvector` database (inspect posts, embeddings, CV data) | DB running on `127.0.0.1:5433`; override URL via `MCP_POSTGRES_URL` |
| `playwright` | Drive a real browser for interactive UI debugging / E2E authoring | none (browser auto-installed) |
| `github` | Manage PRs, issues and Dependabot alerts | export `GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN` (never committed) |

```bash
# Optional overrides before launching Claude Code
export GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN=ghp_xxx        # for the github server
export MCP_POSTGRES_URL=postgresql://user:pass@host:5433/mavrov  # non-default DB
```

Secrets are supplied only via environment variables — `.mcp.json` contains no credentials.

## 🧪 Testing

We verify the application at four levels, and a merged PR must be validated on every one that
applies to it (CLAUDE.md rule 12):

| Layer | Where | What it proves |
|---|---|---|
| Unit — backend | `backend/tests/` | handler/service logic, error paths; **100% required** |
| Unit — frontend | `projects/*/src/**/*.spec.ts` | component/service logic; **100% required** on all three projects |
| Black-box integration | `backend/tests_integration/` | the composed stack over real HTTP, with **WireMock standing in for the model server** (credential-free by construction) |
| End-to-end | `frontend/e2e/` | the product in a real browser — SSR, hydration, zoneless repaints, and the flows a visitor or operator actually walks |

Coverage percentage is not quality: v1.12.0 shipped three screens at 100% unit coverage that had
never rendered in a browser. Ask what breaks that every unit test would still pass through, and
write *that* test.

### 1. Unit tests (backend + frontend)

```bash
# Backend (needs Postgres on 127.0.0.1:5433; point TEST_DATABASE_URL at a test_* DB —
# see README_TESTING.md for the isolation rules)
cd backend && pytest

# Frontend (all three workspace projects: shared, public, admin)
cd frontend && npm test
```

### 2. End-to-End (E2E)

**Prerequisite:** the E2E suite runs against a live stack — start it first
(`./manage.sh start`, or the dedicated compose E2E stack that `./verify_all.sh` uses).

```bash
cd frontend
npx playwright test                        # both suites
npx playwright test --project=public-e2e   # public app only
npx playwright test --project=admin-e2e    # admin app only
npx playwright test e2e/admin/inbox.spec.ts # one spec file
```

The suite covers the public site (SSR + hydration, blog, CV, i18n switching, the contact form
incl. a phone viewport and an accessibility pass) and the admin console (auth, posts, tags, SQL,
profile, **Inbox** with pagination and failure states, **Pipeline board** with stage moves and
quick-create, the promote hand-off from Inbox to pipeline, and the **interview Calendar** —
zoneless repaint, the authenticated `.ics` download with the Authorization header asserted on the
wire, and the rejected-outcome snap-back).

### 3. Black-box integration tier (WireMock)

```bash
./run_integration_tests.sh          # boots the stack with ollama replaced by WireMock
./backend/perf/run_jmeter.sh        # JMeter smoke with executable latency budgets
```

Real HTTP against a running stack, with deterministic AI stubs and fault injection
(`__wiremock_slow__` / `__wiremock_error__`). It gates publishing in CI — the four publish jobs
`need` it. Details are in `README_TESTING.md`. **Note:** the stack currently publishes Postgres
on the same host port as your local test database (5433), so booting it evicts that DB and the
next `pytest` fails with a confusing authentication error — stop the stack first.

### 4. Verification Script

Run the entire test suite (Lint, Type Check, Unit, E2E) in one go:

```bash
./verify_all.sh
```

### 5. Tooling self-tests

The scripts that *guard* the repo are themselves tested — they run on throwaway
fixtures and never touch your working tree:

```bash
bash test-bump-version.sh                      # version carriers + CHANGELOG rotation (#186/#193)
bash setup.test.sh                             # the onboarding wizard's guards (11 cases, #61)
bash .claude/hooks/guard-destructive.test.sh   # destructive-command guard (#116/#188)
bash .claude/hooks/pre-push-tests.test.sh      # the pre-push gate's own parsing (#237)
sh proxy/test-generate-admin-config.sh         # admin allowlist / real_ip generator (#86)
bash scripts/check_no_pii.sh                   # no personal identifiers in tracked sources (#66)
```

`scripts/check_live_freshness.sh <url> <version>` is the same family — it powers the daily
Live Freshness workflow and answers `0 fresh / 1 stale / 2 unreachable`, so a green pipeline can
never be mistaken for a live site (#169). A self-test for it is tracked in #280.

`test-bump-version.sh` also runs in CI: the `version-consistency` job executes it
plus `./bump_version.sh --check`, and every image-build job depends on that job, so
a version-carrier mismatch fails the pipeline before anything is published.

## 🔧 Configuration

### Backend Environment Variables

The Docker stack takes everything from the ROOT `.env` (created by
`./setup.sh`; full samples in `.env.example` and `backend/.env.example`).
A `backend/.env` is only for running the backend BARE-METAL outside compose:

```bash
DATABASE_URL=postgresql+asyncpg://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/mavrov
OLLAMA_URL=http://localhost:11434
EMBEDDING_MODEL=nomic-embed-text
HIREFOLIO_GEMINI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here

# Fernet key that encrypts the per-user Gemini API key at rest (issue #143).
# Empty = plaintext passthrough (backward compatible); set in prod to encrypt.
# Generate: python -c "from cryptography.fernet import Fernet; print(Fernet.generate_key().decode())"
HIREFOLIO_GEMINI_ENCRYPTION_KEY=                          # default: "" (encryption disabled)
#
# NOTE (encrypting EXISTING keys): the `encrypt0002` migration runs once at
# deploy. If HIREFOLIO_GEMINI_ENCRYPTION_KEY was still empty when it ran, existing keys
# stay plaintext — setting the key later does NOT retroactively encrypt them.
# After enabling the key, encrypt existing rows by either (a) re-saving the key
# in the admin profile UI, or (b) running the idempotent backfill once:
#   cd backend && HIREFOLIO_GEMINI_ENCRYPTION_KEY=... python -m scripts.backfill_encrypt_gemini_key
# (Regardless of encryption, `/auth/me` never returns the raw key — the network
# EXPOSURE is closed independently of encryption-at-rest.)

# LinkedIn import (optional — leave blank to disable the import endpoint)
LINKEDIN_IMPORT_TOKEN=your_machine_token_here   # default: "" (disabled)
IMPORT_MAX_IMAGE_MB=10                          # default: 10 MB

# Where the saved LinkedIn login session is stored. Defaults to
# /data/linkedin_cookies, backed by the `linkedin_cookies` named volume so the
# session survives container recreates/deploys.
LINKEDIN_COOKIES_DIR=/data/linkedin_cookies    # default: /data/linkedin_cookies

# Operational tuning (issue #207). Each default equals the literal it replaced,
# so omitting the whole block keeps the previous behaviour. These are the values
# whose correct setting depends on the host rather than on the application —
# pagination sizes and API-contract bounds are deliberately NOT here, since they
# are already per-request parameters.
LLM_REQUEST_TIMEOUT_SECONDS=300            # default: 300 — a full LLM completion
LLM_STREAM_TIMEOUT_SECONDS=30              # default: 30  — streamed chat POST
EMBEDDING_REQUEST_TIMEOUT_SECONDS=30       # default: 30
OLLAMA_HEALTHCHECK_TIMEOUT_SECONDS=2       # default: 2   — drives the AI-status probe
OLLAMA_STARTUP_CHECK_TIMEOUT_SECONDS=10    # default: 10  — one-shot startup check
OLLAMA_PREFLIGHT_TIMEOUT_SECONDS=5         # default: 5   — multi-agent conversation pre-flight
PROFILE_DATA_TIMEOUT_SECONDS=5             # default: 5
DB_RESTORE_TIMEOUT_SECONDS=300             # default: 300 — psql restore ceiling
IMPORT_MAX_POSTS_JSON_MB=10                # default: 10 MB
IMPORT_MAX_POSTS_PER_REQUEST=500           # default: 500 entries

# Transparent translation (#248) — forwarded by both compose files.
TRANSLATION_ENABLED=true                   # default: true — false disables cleanly
OWNER_LANGUAGE=en                          # default: en — ISO 639-1; casing/region normalized
```

### Root Environment (Docker Compose)

Docker Compose auto-loads `.env` from the project root — it configures the
compose stacks (image registry/tag, hostnames, admin allowlist, ports, …).
Copy [`.env.example`](.env.example) to `.env` and adjust; every knob is
documented there and has a safe default.

### Deploying as a new owner (fork & go)

All owner-specific deployment/infra settings are externalized behind env/config — a forker
deploys by editing **only** [`.env`](.env.example) (and, for CI publishing, GitHub repository
variables), never tracked source. Copy [`.env.example`](.env.example) to `.env` and set what
identifies you. Every knob has a safe default that preserves the canonical behavior:

| Knob | Where | Default | What it controls |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `IMAGE_REPO` | `.env` (compose) | `ghcr.io/mavrovde/hirefolio` (prod), `mavrovde` (dev) | Registry/org/name the compose files pull `-backend/-frontend/-admin-frontend/-proxy` images from |
| `IMAGE_TAG` | `.env` (compose) | repo `VERSION` | Pinned image tag to run |
| `REGISTRY`, `IMAGE_NAME` | GitHub **repository variables** | `ghcr.io`, `${{ github.repository }}` | Where `deploy.yml` publishes images (override to retarget the CI publish) |
| `PUBLIC_SERVER_NAME` | `.env` (proxy) | `mavrov.de www.mavrov.de` | Public site hostname(s) the reverse proxy answers on |
| `ADMIN_SERVER_NAME` | `.env` (proxy) | `admin.mavrov.de admin.localhost` | Admin console hostname(s) |
| `ADMIN_ALLOWED_CIDRS` | `.env` (proxy) | *empty → CLOSED (loopback only)* | Trusted operator IPs/CIDRs allowed to reach the admin console. **Never `0.0.0.0/0` in prod.** |
| `TRUSTED_PROXY_CIDRS` | `.env` (proxy) | `172.16.0.0/12` (Docker bridge) | Upstream CIDR(s) nginx trusts for the forwarded-for header (real client IP recovery) |
| `REAL_IP_HEADER` | `.env` (proxy) | `X-Forwarded-For` | Header carrying the real client IP (set `X-Real-IP` if your front proxy uses it) |
| `POSTGRES_PORT` | `.env` (compose) | `5433` | Postgres listen port + host mapping + backend `DATABASE_URL` |

The reverse proxy renders its `server_name` from `PUBLIC_SERVER_NAME`/`ADMIN_SERVER_NAME` at
container start (`proxy/entrypoint.sh` → envsubst on `proxy/default.conf.template`).

**Admin console access (#86).** The admin subdomain ships **CLOSED** to the public. Because Docker
NAT masks every external client to the bridge gateway inside the container, the proxy first uses
nginx `real_ip` to recover the true client IP from the front proxy's forwarded header
(`set_real_ip_from ${TRUSTED_PROXY_CIDRS}` + `real_ip_header ${REAL_IP_HEADER}` +
`real_ip_recursive on`, generated into `proxy/real_ip.conf`), then filters that IP against the
allowlist generated from `ADMIN_ALLOWED_CIDRS` into `proxy/admin_allowlist.conf` (both by
`proxy/generate-admin-config.sh` at start; the committed files are the safe defaults + fallback).
With `ADMIN_ALLOWED_CIDRS` empty only loopback reaches admin; set your operator IPs/CIDRs to open
it. **Prerequisite:** your front proxy must forward the real client IP in `REAL_IP_HEADER` and its
egress must fall inside `TRUSTED_PROXY_CIDRS` — verify the proxy access logs show the real external
client IP (not the gateway) before relying on the allowlist. A fail-safe re-tests the generated
config (`nginx -t`) and falls back to a closed default if it is invalid, so a bad allowlist can
never crash nginx or silently misfilter. **Break-glass** (works even with an empty allowlist): reach
admin over loopback from on the box, e.g. `docker compose exec proxy wget -qO- --no-check-certificate
--header 'Host: admin.<your-domain>' https://127.0.0.1/`, or an SSH tunnel that originates inside the
proxy container. Pinned third-party base images (`pgvector/pgvector:pg16`,
`ollama/ollama:0.5.7`, `ghcr.io/open-webui/open-webui:v0.11.0`) are pinned in one place:
`docker-compose.prod.yml`. CI does **not** cache these multi-GB images — measured net-negative
(see `.claude/skills/lessons-learned/SKILL.md` §5); the E2E job pulls them registry-direct
during `docker compose up`. The **Ollama model weights** (`nomic-embed-text`,
`llama3.2`, `llama3.2:1b`) are pulled by the stack at startup and are deliberately **not** cached
in CI either — multi-GB actions caches restore as slowly as a fresh pull.

### Frontend Environment

Each app has its own environment files:
`frontend/projects/public/src/environments/environment.ts` (+ `.prod.ts`) and
`frontend/projects/admin/src/environments/environment.ts` (+ `.prod.ts`).
For example (public):

```typescript
export const environment = {
  production: false,
  apiUrl: '',
  apiPrefix: '/api/app',
  // Deprecated (#65): analytics is RUNTIME config now — set
  // HIREFOLIO_ANALYTICS_ID in the host .env; this field is inert.
  googleAnalyticsId: '',
};
```

## 📣 Owner notifications — channels (#263)

Every new inbox interaction fans out to **all configured channels**; a channel exists exactly
when its config does, and one dead channel never blocks another (nor intake).

| Channel | Config | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Email | `SMTP_*` | the pre-existing path, unchanged |
| **Telegram** | `HIREFOLIO_TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` + `HIREFOLIO_TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID` | **2-minute setup**: message [@BotFather](https://t.me/botfather) → `/newbot` → copy the token; then message your bot once and read your chat id from `https://api.telegram.org/bot<token>/getUpdates`. Free; lands on your phone in seconds. |
| Webhook | `HIREFOLIO_NOTIFY_WEBHOOK_URL` | provider-agnostic JSON POST (`text` + structured fields) — works as-is with Slack/Mattermost incoming webhooks and ntfy |

**WhatsApp — a documented decision, not a missing feature:** the Business Cloud API requires a
Meta-verified business account, pre-approved message templates, and bills per conversation.
That cost/approval model makes it a deliberate later adapter; the channel seam
(`NotificationChannel` in `backend/app/services/notifications.py`) makes it one small class the
day an owner actually needs it. No stub pretends otherwise.
## 🌐 Transparent translation (#248)

Recruiter messages arrive in any language; the inbox detects it and shows a translation into
your language (`OWNER_LANGUAGE`, default `en`) — **clearly labeled as machine-generated, with
the original always one click away and never modified in storage**. Local Ollama by default
(nothing leaves your machine); your Gemini key upgrades it if configured. `TRANSLATION_ENABLED=false`
turns the whole feature off cleanly.

## 🌐 API Endpoints

### Blog Posts

- `GET /api/posts` - List all posts (with filters)
- `GET /api/posts/{slug}` - Get specific post
- `POST /api/posts` - Create new post
- `PUT /api/posts/{slug}` - Update post
- `DELETE /api/posts/{slug}` - Delete post
- `GET /api/posts/{slug}/similar` - Find similar posts
- `GET /api/posts/search/semantic?q=query` - Semantic search

### Recruiter interactions (#69)

- `POST /api/app/interactions/contact` - Public contact form (rate-limited per client IP; validated + normalized input)
- `GET /api/app/admin/interactions` - Admin inbox: filter by `status`/`source`, paginated (auth required)
- `PATCH /api/app/admin/interactions/{id}` - Move an interaction through the status workflow (auth required)

### Job-search pipeline (#247, phase 1)

All admin-only (auth required):

- `GET /api/app/admin/opportunities` - Pipeline board data: filter by `stage`, paginated
- `POST /api/app/admin/opportunities` - Create an opportunity (strip-then-validate input contract)
- `GET /api/app/admin/opportunities/{id}` - Detail incl. the notes timeline
- `PATCH /api/app/admin/opportunities/{id}/stage` - Move a card through the stage workflow
- `GET/PUT /api/app/admin/site-settings/availability` - The owner's **job-search state**
  (`open|listening|not_looking`), shown on the public hero beside the Hire-me CTA; editable at
  runtime with no redeploy, served publicly via `/config/site` (an older backend without the field
  degrades to `listening` client-side)
- `POST /api/app/admin/cv/upload` now takes **`activate`** (form field, default `true`):
  `false` uploads a **variant** — listed in `/versions`, attachable to opportunities — while the
  public `/cv/download` keeps serving the current default untouched
- `POST /api/app/admin/opportunities/{id}/cv-sent` - Record which **CV variant** went to this
  company (`cv_document_id`): sets the current pointer + timestamp and appends the durable
  `CV sent: version (filename)` note to the timeline. Never touches which CV the public flow
  serves (`is_active`) — independent facts, pinned by test
- `POST /api/app/admin/opportunities/{id}/notes` - Append a timeline note (optionally linked to an inbox interaction)
- `POST /api/app/admin/opportunities/promote` - Promote an inbox interaction into an opportunity (advances the interaction new → in_progress). **Idempotent per interaction**: a repeat call returns the card created by the first one — enforced by a UNIQUE constraint, so concurrent requests collapse to one card rather than racing. Overrides (`company`, `role_title`) therefore apply only to the FIRST promotion; changing a card afterwards is an edit, not a re-promote. The card's `source` is derived from the interaction's origin (contact_form → recruiter_outreach, cv_request/booking → discovery)

### Interview calendar (#247 phase 2 / #70)

All admin-only (auth required). Timestamps are stored and returned in **UTC**; any ISO-8601
offset is accepted on input and normalized (a value without an offset is read as UTC).

- `POST /api/app/admin/opportunities/{id}/interviews` - Schedule a slot (`scheduled_at`,
  `duration_minutes` 5–1440, `kind` ∈ `phone|video|onsite|other`, `location_or_link`,
  `interviewer`, `notes`). Advances the opportunity to `interviewing` **forward only** — a card
  already at `offer`/`closed_*` keeps its stage — writes the change to the notes timeline, and
  emails the owner a **reminder with the `.ics` invite attached** (same VEVENT as the export
  route, stable UID) via the configured SMTP; skipped silently when SMTP is unconfigured, and a
  mail failure never fails the scheduling.
- `GET /api/app/admin/opportunities/{id}/interviews` - Every interview on one opportunity, soonest first
- `GET /api/app/admin/interviews/upcoming?days=14` - Scheduled interviews across **all**
  opportunities inside the window (1–365 days), soonest first, cancelled slots excluded; each row
  carries its `company`/`role_title`/`stage` so a dashboard needs no second request
- `GET /api/app/admin/interviews/{id}` - One interview
- `GET /api/app/admin/interviews/{id}.ics` - **Calendar export**: a minimal RFC 5545 VEVENT
  (UTC `DTSTART`/`DTEND`, escaped TEXT values, 75-octet line folding, `STATUS:CANCELLED` for a
  cancelled slot, stable `UID` derived from the row id + `SITE_URL` host) served as
  `text/calendar` with a download `Content-Disposition`
- `PATCH /api/app/admin/interviews/{id}` - Reschedule and/or record the outcome
  (`pending|passed|failed|cancelled`); only the keys sent are applied, and reschedules/outcome
  changes are appended to the opportunity's notes timeline. A **genuine move** (new instant) also
  re-sends the owner reminder with the updated invite; outcome-only edits and same-instant
  "reschedules" send nothing
- `DELETE /api/app/admin/interviews/{id}` - Remove a mis-created slot (204). The removal is
  written to the notes timeline first, so the history survives the row; to keep an interview that
  simply did not happen, PATCH its outcome to `cancelled` instead

#### Post model — LinkedIn provenance fields (nullable)

| Column | Type | Constraint | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| `source_urn` | `String` | unique when not null (partial index) | LinkedIn activity URN; enables idempotent imports |
| `source_url` | `String(512)` | — | LinkedIn permalink for the original post |
| `posted_at` | `DateTime(tz=True)` | — | Original publish timestamp from LinkedIn |

All three columns are `NULL` for posts not imported from LinkedIn. Two posts may both have
`source_urn = NULL`; two non-null URNs must be distinct (enforced by
`ix_post_source_urn_unique`).

#### Database migrations

| Revision | Description |
|---|---|
| `baseline0001` | Baseline schema — all current tables (`users`, `cv_documents`, `cv_requests`, `posts` incl. `image_url`/`image_blob`/`image_type` and LinkedIn provenance columns, `profile_snapshots`). Consolidates what used to be several disjoint/incomplete revisions (see #46). |
| `encrypt0002` | Encrypts stored per-user Gemini API keys at rest (Fernet via `HIREFOLIO_GEMINI_ENCRYPTION_KEY`); one-time backfill of existing plaintext keys — a no-op if the key env var is empty when it runs (see #143 and the note in the backend env section above). |
| `inbox0003` | Recruiter communication hub (#69): the `interactions` table (unified inbox — source, status workflow, JSON payload, indexes on status/source/created_at). Self-adopting: a no-op if `create_all` already made the table (pre-Alembic installs). |
| `pipeline0004` | Job-search pipeline phase 1 (#247): `opportunities` + `opportunity_notes` tables (stage workflow, recruiter fields, notes timeline linked to inbox interactions). Self-adopting per the guard above. |
| `promote0005` | Promote-from-inbox idempotency (#279): unique `opportunities.promoted_from_interaction_id` + an index on `opportunity_notes.interaction_id`, backfilled from the promotion note. |
| `interview0006` | Interview calendar, pipeline phase 2 (#247/#70): the `interviews` table (UTC `scheduled_at`, duration, kind, location/link, interviewer, outcome) with `ON DELETE CASCADE` to `opportunities` and indexes for per-opportunity listing + the "next N days" range scan. Self-adopting: when the table already exists it adds only the missing indexes, comparing **column sets, not names** (a name check adds duplicates — see the guard note below). |

New changes get their own revision on top of this baseline — see
[How to write a migration](#how-to-write-a-migration) above.
**Every post-baseline `create_table`/`create_index` migration MUST start with the
self-adopt guard** (`if sa.inspect(op.get_bind()).has_table("..."): return`) — pre-Alembic
installs got their schema from `create_all` and already have an unpredictable subset of
tables (see `inbox0003` and the lessons-learned entry). When the guard has to decide whether an
**index or constraint** is already there, compare **column sets**, never names
(`{tuple(i["column_names"]) for i in inspector.get_indexes(table)}`): `create_all` names objects
differently from the migration, so a name check believes they are missing and creates duplicates
— which `alembic check` cannot see, because it compares column sets too (see `interview0006`).

### Health Check

- `GET /` - Welcome message
- `GET /api/app/ping` - Liveness (always `200 {"ping": "ok"}` once the process is up)
- `GET /api/app/health` - **Readiness** — `200 {"status": "healthy", "ready": true}` only once the
  schema (Alembic migrations) is present. During the cold-start window where uvicorn is up but
  `alembic upgrade head` (run by `docker-entrypoint.sh`) has not finished, it returns a retryable
  `503 {"status": "initializing", "ready": false}` so orchestrators / the E2E gate wait on true
  readiness instead of racing into a raw `500 UndefinedTableError` (see #124).

## 🤖 Ollama Integration

The application uses Ollama for local, free embeddings:

- **Model**: `nomic-embed-text`
- **Dimensions**: 768
- **Cost**: $0 (completely free)
- **Privacy**: All data stays local
- **Speed**: Fast local inference

### Manual Ollama Commands

```bash
# Check available models
curl http://localhost:11434/api/tags

# Generate embedding
curl http://localhost:11434/api/embeddings -d '{
  "model": "nomic-embed-text",
  "prompt": "Your text here"
}'
```

## 📝 Blog Management

### Create Blog Post

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/posts \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "title": "My Post",
    "slug": "my-post",
    "content": "Post content...",
    "summary": "Brief summary",
    "language": "en",
    "published": true
  }'
```

### Semantic Search

```bash
curl "http://localhost:8000/api/posts/search/semantic?q=ollama+embeddings&lang=en"
```

## 🚢 Deployment

> **Full runbook:** [`docs/DEPLOYMENT.md`](docs/DEPLOYMENT.md) — clean-server first deploy, the
> `DEPLOY_*` secrets that arm the automated rollout, and the required host `.env` values
> (`ADMIN_PASSWORD`, `JWT_SECRET_KEY`).

### What CI publishes

Every merge to `main` runs `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`: after the lint /
type / unit-test / security gates it builds and pushes four images to GitHub
Container Registry (anonymously pullable), then runs the full Docker E2E
against exactly those images:

```text
ghcr.io/mavrovde/hirefolio-backend:sha-<gitsha>
ghcr.io/mavrovde/hirefolio-frontend:sha-<gitsha>
ghcr.io/mavrovde/hirefolio-admin-frontend:sha-<gitsha>
ghcr.io/mavrovde/hirefolio-proxy:sha-<gitsha>
```

After a green E2E each `sha-<gitsha>` image is also promoted to the
`<VERSION>` and `latest` tags. GHCR is the project's registry, and the prod compose
files already default `IMAGE_REPO` to it — override it only when deploying from
a different registry/org (below).

### Rolling out to the host

Since #175 the pipeline ends with a **secrets-gated `Roll Out To Prod Host` job**:
when `DEPLOY_HOST` / `DEPLOY_USER` / `DEPLOY_SSH_KEY` are configured it SSHes to
the host, deploys the immutable `sha-<gitsha>` tag, verifies the containers by
image digest, health-gates `/api/app/health`, freshness-probes `/admin/login`
(→ 404) and rolls back on failure. **Without those secrets it skips and the run
is still green — nothing is rolled out** (the original #112 / #156 gap). See
[`docs/DEPLOYMENT.md`](docs/DEPLOYMENT.md). To roll out manually, on the host
set in the root `.env`:

```bash
IMAGE_REPO=ghcr.io/mavrovde/hirefolio
IMAGE_TAG=<version>          # e.g. the current VERSION, or sha-<gitsha>
```

then:

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml pull
docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d
```

## 🛠️ Development

### Hot Reload

- **Frontend**: Automatic with `ng serve`
- **Backend**: Use `uvicorn app.main:app --reload`

### Code Quality

```bash
# Backend lint + format + types + security (what CI runs)
cd backend
ruff check .
ruff format --check .        # or `ruff format .` to apply formatting
mypy app --ignore-missing-imports --no-error-summary
bandit -r app -ll --skip B101

# Frontend: no linter is configured (CI's `npm run lint --if-present` is a no-op);
# the type gate is the build itself:
cd frontend
npm run build
```

## 📊 Test Coverage

- **Backend**: 100% line & branch coverage — the maintained project standard
  (engineering rule: never below 95%); `pytest` reports it on every run
- **Frontend**: 100% coverage (statements, branches, functions, lines), maintained
  per workspace project (`shared`, `public`, `admin`)
- **E2E**: Playwright suites (`public-e2e`, `admin-e2e`) against the full Docker stack
  (real Ollama integration)

Run coverage reports:

```bash
# Backend
cd backend
pytest --cov=app --cov-report=html
open htmlcov/index.html

# Frontend (per-project reports under coverage/{shared,public,admin}/)
cd frontend
npm run test:coverage
open coverage/public/index.html
```
