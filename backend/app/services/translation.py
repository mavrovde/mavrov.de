"""Transparent translation of recruiter messages (#248).

TRANSPARENT means three hard rules, all pinned by tests:
- the stored ORIGINAL is never mutated — translation lives in separate,
  re-runnable columns;
- the translation is clearly machine-labeled at the UI, with the original a
  toggle away;
- intake never fails or blocks because translation failed — it runs as a
  background task and records its own status.

The LLM boundary follows the stack's one fallback pattern (rule 10): Gemini
when a key is configured, local Ollama otherwise — private and free by
default, and CI's empty key can never reach a paid API.
